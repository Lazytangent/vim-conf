# Vim Config

To set up on your machine, run 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lazytangent/dot-vim.git ~/.vim
```

Then copy the `.vimrc` from the cloned repo into your home directory:

```bash
cd ~/.vim
cp .vimrc ~/
```

WARNING: This last `cp` command will overwrite any file named `.vimrc` that you had in your home directory. That being the case, you may want to make a backup of that file somewhere so you don't just lose it.
